				<para>The first region scanned  receives the value one, the second two, and so forth, until all regions are assigned a value. The scan moves from left to right, top to bottom. The values assigned to the output zones are based on when they are encountered in the scanning process.</para>

				<para>By default, the Add Link option is True. This will create an item called LINK in the attribute table of the output raster, which retains the original value for each cell from the input raster.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>The LINK field allows you to trace the parentage of each of the newly created regions for queries or analysis.</para><para>For example, the attribute table for the output raster shown in the illustration above is:</para>
				
					
					
					</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Setting the Add Link option to False will significantly speed up processing. This is helpful when the original value of each region is no longer needed.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>If a  has been set in the evironment, those cells that have been masked will receive NoData on the output raster. With a mask, the spatial configuration and the number of regions may be altered on the output raster. If a region was continuous and the imposition of a mask breaks the continuity, the region will be divided into two regions with different values or grouping identifiers on the output raster.</para>
				<para>The mask cannot only create additional regions by dividing a region into two or more separate regions, it can also reduce the number of regions on the output. If a mask totally covers or eliminates a potential region of connected cells, these cells will not be considered as a new zone on the output; they will receive NoData values.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Region Group is especially useful when the analysis is on regions and not on zones. Since the input zone value is maintained, the original zonal class can also be used in the analysis.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Cell locations that contain the excluded value receive zero on the output so that these zones are not confused with existing NoData cell locations. Since the Region Group begins numbering with the value 1, the cells that are excluded from the regroup are considered background. These background cells can be reclassed or manipulated as any other value. The locations containing excluded values can easily be converted to NoData using the  tool.</para>
