				<para>Boundaries of interior polygons in the erase coverage are not used in ERASE. Any erase coverage polygon whose internal number is greater than one is considered inside the erasing window; an internal polygon number of one is considered outside.

				<para>The outside boundaries of the erase coverage define the area of Input coverage features to be removed. Any erase coverage polygon with an internal number greater than one is considered inside the erasing window; an internal polygon number of one is considered outside.</para>

				<para>If the erase coverage polygon happens to fall completely within an input polygon, then no polygons are erased. An extra polygon is inserted in the output coverage, as defined by the outline polygon of the erase coverage, and given a label point with a User-ID = 0. This is for the POLY option. If the LINE option is used, then nothing extra is added. The output coverage remains identical to the input coverage.</para>

For example, with coincident or colinear arcs such as arcs representing utility cables at different levels or a road following a stream, the coincident and colinear line segments will be preserved. However, additional vertices may be inserted. In the case of intersecting arcs such as a road passing over a stream, nodes will not be inserted at the apparent intersection.</para>
