        <summary>
            <para>Environment settings specified in this dialog box are values that will be applied to appropriate results from running tools. They can be set hierarchically, meaning that they can be set for the application you are working in, so they apply to all tools; for a model, so they apply to all processes within the model; or for a particular process within a model. Environments set for a process within a model will overrride all other setting, and environments set for all processes in a model will override those set in the application.</para>
            <para>Changing the default settings that will be used is a prerequisite to performing geoprocessing tasks. You may only be interested in analyzing a small piece of a geographic area, such as changing the extent for results, or you may want to write all results to a specific location (for example, changing the current workspace or the scratch workspace).</para>

You can think of this setting as a rectangle used to select input features and rasters for processing. Any feature or raster that passes through the rectangle will be processed and written to output. Note that the rectangle is used only to select features, not clip them. The extent of the output dataset will typically be larger than the Output Extent setting to account for features that pass through the extent rectangle.

The next time you examine the Extent setting, it will read As Specified Below. If you subsequently change the extent of the display or layer, the Extent setting is not updated—you will have to reset the Extent environment.

                        When working with geographic transformations, if the direction is not indicated, geoprocessing tools will handle the directionality automatically. For example, if converting data from WGS 1984 to NAD 1927, you can pick a transformation called NAD_1927_to_WGS_1984_3 and the software will apply it correctly.
