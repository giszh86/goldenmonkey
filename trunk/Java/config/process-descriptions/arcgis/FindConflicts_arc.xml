				<para>Finding conflicts among simplified buildings is a part of the postprocessing of the  tool. Therefore, the input coverage must have buildings as regions created by the Simplify Building tool followed by the  tool with the POLY option.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>This tool will help you locate where buildings are within the specified distance. A buffer will be created around each building or group of connected buildings. Overlapping buffers indicate a conflict. An item, FREQUENCY, will be added to the out_cover.PAT, carrying the number of buffers that share each polygon. A FREQUENCY value of 1 means no conflict; a value of 2 or more, according to how many buffers overlap, indicates a conflict area. Buildings connected in one group are not considered conflicting with each other. Only the outer boundary of such a group will be checked with neighboring buildings or groups of buildings.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>The output coverage is created only if conflicts are identified. Since the input buildings are regions, the buffers in the output coverage are also regions with a subclass BUF. You can select and view the conflict areas (the polygons with a FREQUENCY value of 2 or more) and make necessary edits.</para>
