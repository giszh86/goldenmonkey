				<para>This tool only creates masks at the unconnected ends of lines (also called  cul-de-sacs). A line end is considered connected if it shares its endpoint with the endpoint of another line. This tool only accepts line layers as input.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item><para>This tool is specifically designed to provide line end masks in cases in which lines have been symbolized using a rounded end cap to smooth the transition of line connections. Rather than having lines end with a rounded end cap, the end of the line can be masked using the polygon feature class created with this tool.</para></bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Masks will be created if the margin distance is 0 or negative. A margin size of 0 will create a polygon that represents the exact shape of the symbolized feature. A negative margin will result in a polygon smaller than the symbolized feature. Generally, a margin value larger than 0 will be specified to produce the desired masking effect.</para>

				<para>If the input line layer contains multipart line geometries, then cul-de-sac masks are created for all unconnected line ends, including the ends of parts within multipart lines.</para>

				<para>When creating masks, it is important to know that adding masks to maps adds complexity that will slow map drawing and affect map printing and exporting. Generally, there are three things to consider when creating masks for a map: (1) the number of masks, (2) the complexity of the masks, and (3) whether the masks will be used to mask polygon features filled with marker or line symbols. An increase in the number of masks, having more complex masks, and/or masking against marker or polygon fill symbols will result in slower drawing on your screen. In addition, printing and exporting performance can be poor and even fail to produce valid output, first, because of the large amount of processing required to print and export maps with masks, and second, because of known limitations in how graphic file formats store map export results that have many complicated masks.</para>
