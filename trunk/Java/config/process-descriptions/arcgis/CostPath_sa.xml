				<para>The Cost Path tool produces an output raster that records the least-cost path or paths from selected locations to the closest source cell defined within the accumulative cost surface, in terms of cost distance.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>One or more of the weighted cost tools (, , or ) are generally required to run prior to running Cost Path to create the input cost distance and back link rasters. These are mandatory input rasters to Cost Path.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Each least-cost path is assigned a value when encountered in the scanning process. The ending cell on the original source raster (from which the cost distance and back link were derived) of a cost path receives one, the first path receives three, the second four, and so on. The value two is reserved for the merged portion of paths that have portions of a common cost path.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>When the input destination data is a raster, the set of destination cells consists of all cells in the input raster or feature destination data that have valid values. Cells that have NoData values are not included in the source set. The value zero is considered a legitimate destination. A destination raster can be easily created using the .</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>When multiple paths merge and follow the remaining distance back to a source on the same route, the segment where the two paths travel together is assigned the value 2. The merged portion of the path cannot be assigned the value of one of the paths, since the merged portion belongs to both routes.</para>
				
					
					
					
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Cost Path does not respect the  environment setting. The analysis extent should not be different from the cost distance and cost back link rasters.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Cost Path will ignore the  environment setting and use the cell size of the Input cost backlink raster for the output raster. The pattern of the back link raster would be seriously altered if it were resampled to a different resolution. To avoid any confusion, the cell size should not be set when using this tool.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>Cost Path can also be used to derive the path of least resistance down a digital elevation model (DEM). In this case, use the DEM for the  Input cost distance raster and the output from the  tool  for the  Input cost backlink raster. Valid flow direction raster values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128; valid values in the back link raster are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Both of these rasters are acceptable.</para>
