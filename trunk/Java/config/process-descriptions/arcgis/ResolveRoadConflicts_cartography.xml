			<para>This tool does not produce output layers but instead alters the source feature classes of the input  layers. If the input layers are drawn with a representation (whose editing behavior is set to store shape overrides), the modified features are stored as shape overrides in the representation. If the layer is not drawn with a representation, the geometry of the input features is modified. Using representations is recommended when working with the conflict resolution tools. That way, if the results are not acceptable, or to rerun the tool with different parameters, simply remove the overrides using the Remove Override tool. It is strongly suggested that you make a copy of your input features if you are not using representations whose editing behavior is set to store shape overrides.</para>
		
			<para> A warning is raised if the input features are not in a projected coordinate system. This tool relies on  linear distance units, which will create unexpected results in an unprojected coordinate system . It is strongly suggested that you run this tool on data in a projected coordinate system to ensure valid results. An error is raised and the tool will not process if the coordinate system is missing or unknown.</para></idAbs><descKeys KeyTypCd="005"><keyTyp><keyTyp>005</keyTyp></keyTyp><keyword>Cartography</keyword><keyword>Classification</keyword><keyword>Conflict Detection</keyword><keyword>Conflict Resolution</keyword><keyword>Disperse</keyword><keyword>Displace</keyword><keyword>Displacement</keyword><keyword>Freeway</keyword><keyword>Geometry Override</keyword><keyword>Graphic Conflict</keyword><keyword>Hierarchy</keyword><keyword>Highway</keyword><keyword>Intersection</keyword><keyword>Lane</keyword><keyword>Move</keyword><keyword>Multilane</keyword><keyword>Overlap</keyword><keyword>Representation</keyword><keyword>Shape Override</keyword><keyword>Street</keyword><keyword>Symbol</keyword><keyword>Symbol Conflict</keyword><keyword>Symbol Footprint</keyword><keyword>Symbolisation</keyword><keyword>Symbolization</keyword><keyword>Symbology</keyword><keyword>Transportation</keyword></descKeys></dataIdInfo><distInfo><distributor><distorFormat><formatName sync="true">ArcToolBox Tool</formatName></distorFormat><distorTran><onLineSrc><linkage /><protocol /><onFunct><onFunctCd /></onFunct></onLineSrc></distorTran></distributor></distInfo><metainfo><metd Sync="TRUE" /></metainfo><mdDateSt Sync="TRUE" /><tool name=" ResolveRoadConflicts " displayname=" Resolve Road Conflicts  (Cartography)" toolboxalias="cartography" softwarerestriction="none"><summary>

				<para>This tool is typically used when producing relatively large-scale products where it is preferable to display divided roads with multiple lanes that are visually distinct. At smaller scales, you may want to use the  tool to display a single representative line for these features instead. If your workflow includes running both tools on the same collection of roads, it is advisable to merge roads prior to resolving road conflicts. </para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para> The Hierarchy Field parameter is used to specify the hierarchical importance of each road class. Lower integers specify more significant roads, with hierarchy  equal to 1 for the most important roads. Movement will be minimized for the most important roads; lower hierarchy roads generally will be moved to accommodate higher hierarchy roads. The hierarchy field must be present and named the same for all input feature classes.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para> This tool operates by assessing graphic conflicts of symbolized features. The symbology extent and the reference scale are considered in conjunction with one another. Run this tool only after you have finalized the appearance of your symbols, and ensure that the reference scale corresponds to the final intended output scale.</para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>You can "lock" features from displacement  by calculating the Hierarchy Field value equal to 0 (zero). This is useful when a road should not be moved because of its a  spatial relationship with other map features, especially continuous data like elevation, and should not be moved. </para>
			</bullet_item><bullet_item>
				<para>The optional Output Displacement Feature Class parameter creates a feature class of  polygons that indicates the amount and direction of displacement that took place. This feature class can be used for visual inspection, for spatial querying, or as an input to the  tool. </para>
