				<para> When you select Use Page Unit and Scale Map, Map Scale becomes a required parameter. If ArcMap is open the map scale of the active data frame will be used; otherwise, the default value is 1. If you are specifying the size of index features in map space and Use Page Unit and Scale is not selected Map Scale is not needed.</para>

				<para>Resulting index features are created with a number of attributes. These attributes include: PageNumber, GroupId, SeqId, PrevPage, NextPage, LeftPage, RightPage, TopPage, BottomPage and Angle.<bulletList>
						<bullet_item>Angle is a numeric value expressing the rotation angle needed by the map (data frame) to align the edges of the index feature with the edges of a layout page. In order to keep within cartographic conventions, these angles are calculated to keep North oriented toward the top of the page as much as possible. Angles are calculated against the default orientation of a map where 0 degrees is due North, 90 degrees is due East, 180 degrees is due South and -90 degrees is due West.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>PageNumber is an incremental number assigned to each index feature.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>GroupId is an integer assigned to all the index features in a connecting chain or group of line features. Strip Map Index Features results can include multiple groups. Usually, a single group will originate from a connected set of line features or from a single line with multiple, unconnected parts. Index features created from Individual, unconnected line features will be assigned to separate groups. GroupId values are unique and are derived from the OID of the first line feature in the given chain.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>SeqId is an incremental number assigned to each index feature based on the creation order for the feature within each group.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>PrevPage is the PageNumber value for the previously created index feature. This field is used in analyzing the creation order of index features. Do not use this field to run dynamic text for a Data Driven Page. Use LeftPage, RightPage, TopPage and BottomPage fields for dynamic text.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>NextPage is the PageNumber value for the next index feature created. This field is used in analyzing the creation order of index features. Do not use this field to run dynamic text for a Data Driven Page. Use LeftPage, RightPage, TopPage, and BottomPage fields for dynamic text.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>LeftPage, RightPage, TopPage, and BottomPage are useful when incorporating the results into Data Driven Pages. LeftPage is the PageNumber value of the index feature that appears to the left of the current index feature after the rotation has been applied. RightPage is the PageNmuber of the index feature to the right. TopPage and BottomPage are the values for the index features to the top and bottom, respectively. </bullet_item>

				<para> When Use Page Unit and Scale is selected the units for Length Along the Line and Length Perpendicular to the Line automatically changes to the page units set in the active map document (if ArcMap is open) or to inches if you are using the tool outside of an ArcMap session. For best results these units should be specified in page units such as inches or centimeters. If Use Page Units and Scale is not selected, units should be specified in map units such as meters, feet, kilometers, miles, or decimal degrees.</para>
