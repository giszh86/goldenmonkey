				<para>Given a set of features, this tool returns three numbers: the minimum, the maximum, and the average distance to a specified number of neighbors (N). Example: if you specify 8 for the Neighbors parameter, this tool creates a list of distances between every feature and its 8th nearest neighbor; from this list of distances it then calculates  the minimum, maximum, and average distance. <bulletList>
						<bullet_item>The maximum value is the distance you would have to travel away from each feature to ensure every feature has at least N neighbors.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>The minimum value is the distance you would travel away from each feature to ensure that at least one feature has N neighbors.</bullet_item>
						<bullet_item>The average value is the average distance you would travel away from each feature to find its N nearest neighbors.</bullet_item>

				<para>Some tools, such as  and , allow you to specify a neighborhood Distance Band or Threshold Distance value. By using the Maximum Distance output value from this tool for the Distance Band or Threshold Distance parameter, you ensure every feature in the input feature class has at least N neighbors. </para>

				<para>For line and polygon features, feature centroids are used in distance computations. For multipoints, polylines, or polygons with multiple parts, the centroid is computed using the weighted mean center of all feature parts. The weighting for point features is 1, for line features is length, and for polygon features is area.</para>
