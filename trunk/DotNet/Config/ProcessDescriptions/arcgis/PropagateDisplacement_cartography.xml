			<para>This tool does not produce output layers but instead alters the source feature classes of the input  layers. If the input layers are drawn with a representation (whose editing behavior is set to store shape overrides), the modified features are stored as shape overrides in the representation. If the layer is not drawn with a representation, the geometry of the input features is modified. Using representations is recommended when working with the conflict resolution tools. That way, if the results are not acceptable, or to rerun the tool with different parameters, simply remove the overrides using the Remove Override tool. It is strongly suggested that you make a copy of your input features if you are not using representations whose editing behavior is set to store shape overrides.</para>

				<para>The location of input features are adjusted based on the vector displacements contained in the displacement features. Adjustments are a compromise of all displacements, such that large displacements that occurred quite near an input feature will have more influence than smaller displacements further away. Conceptually, this action is similar to a rubber-sheeting process that moves features in various directions by various amounts to fit them back to the spatial relationship that they originally had with the roads.</para>

				<para> This tool does not resolve graphic conflicts and in fact may introduce new conflicts. Topological errors that are introduced can be inspected using the  tool. If you are using this tool to propagate  displacement  to building features, consider running the  tool after propagation. </para>
